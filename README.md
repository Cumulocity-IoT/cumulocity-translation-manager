# Translation UI Plugin

## General

Manage your translations in Cumulocity IoT for all supported languages easily using the Translation UI Plugin. Translations can be added and updated using the Translation table. Translations are globally available in all Cumulocity applications running on the same Cumulocity tenant via the `public-options` application and its `options.json` file. 

The Translation UI Plugin automatically register a new navigation entry in the left side navigation menu. The Translation Plugin can be accessed by navigating to `Configuration` -> `Localization`. 

> **Important:** If the Plugin is used in an application it needs to check if the `public-options` application exists. The `public-options` application is used to store and share translations to the different applications. In case the application doesn't exist, it will automatically be created in the Cumulocity tenant via the Translation UI Plugin. Creating this application requires `Admin` permission on `Application management`. Therefore, make sure the plugin is initally called with a user having the necessary permission, otherwise an error will be thrown.

## Local development

### Recommended version

* node v 14.x
* npm v 6.x

### Plugin versions

* Angular v 14.x
* WebSDK v 1017.0.x

**How to start**
Change the target tenant and application you want to run this plugin on in the `package.json`.

```
c8ycli server -u https://{{your-tenant}}.cumulocity.com/ --shell {{cockpit}}
```
Keep in mind that this plugin needs to have an app (e.g. cockpit) running with at least the same version as this plugin. if your tenant contains an older version, use the c8ycli to create a cockpit clone running with at least v 1017.0.x! Upload this clone to the target tenant (e.g. cockpit-1017) and reference this name in the --shell command.

The widget plugin can be locally tested via the start script:

```
npm start
```

In the Module Federation terminology, `widget` plugin is called `remote` and the `cokpit` is called `shell`. Modules provided by this `widget` will be loaded by the `cockpit` application at the runtime. This plugin provides a basic custom widget that can be accessed through the `Add widget` menu.

> Note that the `--shell` flag creates a proxy to the cockpit application and provides` AdvancedMapWidgetModule` as an `remote` via URL options.

Also deploying needs no special handling and can be simply done via `npm run deploy`. As soon as the application has exports it will be uploaded as a plugin.
